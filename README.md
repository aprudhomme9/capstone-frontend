## Watch With Friends

A community app for movie and TV lovers to connect, discuss, and share recommendations

Users can search for movies/tv shows via search bar. The home page also displays popular movies and tv shows based on number of favorites/recommendations/adds to watchlists

From search results, user can click on movie/show and view show details and info

User can favorite, add to watchlist, or recommend to their movie buds

User profile contains their favorite movies/shows, their watchlist - with progress bar - as well as their 'groups'. The user profile also contains their Watch With Friends profile - a graphical representation of their taste in movies and shows based off of genre and other watching patterns. For example, if the user has 10 favorited movies, a bar graph will show the distribution of genres (this is simplistic. ideally the statistics will be a bit more advanced)

User can add movies to favorites/watchlist, remove movies from favorites/watchlist, join groups, leave groups, create/remove comments in discussions, create recommendations

Through the 'groups' link, users can view their groups or recommended groups, which will show up based on their preferences (if they favorite many horror movies, a horror group will be recommended). For MVP, these groups are already built in

The user can then view a group, which will show popular movies and shows that the group's members have been favoriting, recommending, or adding to their watchlist. Each group will also contain a discussion, with comments/recommendations from group members

The user may join the group, and the group will then appear in that user's profile

When the user clicks the 'movie buds' link, their movie buds will appear, along with the option to search for friends

From here, the user can view a friends profile and 'follow' that friend, which adds that friend to the user's movie buds

The user has an inbox, which will display read and unread recommendations from friends, which include an optional comment from that friend. User can check 'read' to move messages to read, and can remove messages from inbox

Users can make recommendations from any movie page by clicking the 'recommend' button and selecting their friend from a dropdown. The user has an option to add a comment
